# Motors Certification (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
The **Motors Certification** project demonstrates my skills in database design and SQL.  
I designed an **ER model**, created tables, inserted sample data, and implemented queries to answer business questions.  
The project also includes **views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers** to show advanced SQL usage.

   - Created tables with primary and foreign key constraints.
3. **Data Insertion**
   - Inserted sample dataset into tables.
4. **Queries**
   - Basic queries (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY)
   - Advanced queries (subqueries, aggregate functions)
5. **Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers**
   - Demonstrated real-world database operations.
6. **Database Backup**
   - `.bak` file for easy restoration.
